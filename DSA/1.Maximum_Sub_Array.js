// This code defines a function called `maximumsubarray`, which takes an array of numbers `nums` as input and returns the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the input array. The function uses the Kadane's algorithm to efficiently find the maximum subarray sum.

// Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

// 1. The function starts by initializing two variables, `maximum` and `current`, both set to the first element of the input array `nums`. These variables will be used to keep track of the maximum sum found so far (`maximum`) and the current sum of the subarray being examined (`current`).

// 2. The function then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the input array, starting from the second element (index 1) because the first element was already assigned to `maximum` and `current`.

// 3. Inside the loop, the function checks whether extending the current subarray by the next element (`nums[i]`) would result in a larger sum than taking `nums[i]` as the start of a new subarray.

// 4. If `current + nums[i] > nums[i]`, it means extending the current subarray is beneficial, so the `current` sum is updated by adding `nums[i]` to it.

// 5. If `current + nums[i] <= nums[i]`, it means starting a new subarray from `nums[i]` would result in a larger sum than continuing the current subarray. In this case, the `current` sum is updated to just be `nums[i]`.

// 6. After updating the `current` sum, the function updates the `maximum` sum by taking the maximum value between the current `maximum` and the updated `current`.

// 7. The loop continues until all elements of the input array have been processed.

// 8. Finally, the function returns the `maximum` sum, which represents the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the input array.

// For example, when the function is called with the input array `[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`, it will find the maximum subarray sum, which is `6`. The maximum subarray is `[4, -1, 2, 1]`, and the sum of these elements is `6`.
