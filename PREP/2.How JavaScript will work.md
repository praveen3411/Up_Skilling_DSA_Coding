### How JavaScript code will work behind the Scenes ?

- Yes JavaScript code will run through "Execution Context"
- In execution Context it can contain two components one is Memory componet we call it as variable Enviornment and second is code execution we can call it as thread of execution
- Once we declare the variable and functions directly it will go to memory component and it will store it in memory component
- So javascript is a single threaded synchnorous programming language.
- it will take single code and excute in the code execution phase
