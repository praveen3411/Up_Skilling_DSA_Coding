### JavaScript Powerful execution.

- Javascript code will run through the execution context
- Execution context will creates the two components - Memory Componet & - Code Component
- Whatever we decleared inside the Javascript Program first it will stores inside the memory component.
- As we know that javascript is a single thread synchronous programming langurage but we know that AJAX let's talk later.
- First in Javascript in the memory component for all the variables and functions it assigns undefined.
- Then it will go line by line in code execution phase. first it will check that the variable is assigned the value or not if it is not assigned then it will print as undefined if the value is assigned then it will print the perfect value.
- If the Memory phase contains Functions. The story is totally different because functions will create the new execution context.
- Here comes the call stack. Wheat it will do means it will store what to call next. if one execution is done it will be pop out and returns to the Global execution context. 
- This is how the code execution will happen in Javascript.
